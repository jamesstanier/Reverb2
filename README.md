# Reverb2 â€” A Novel Schroeder-Based Reverberator

Reverb2 is a digital audio **reverberation engine** inspired by the classic [Schroeder configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation#Digital_reverberation), but with a novel twist:  
it enhances the perceived sound quality not only through the traditional longer delay lines, but also by introducing **very short delays** that add richness, depth, and clarity without smearing the audio.  

This approach was loosely inspired by ideas discussed in [Coding a Basic Reverb Algorithm](https://medium.com/the-seekers-project/coding-a-basic-reverb-algorithm-an-introduction-to-audio-programming-d5d90ad58bde), but extends them with an original design that goes beyond conventional Schroeder reverbs.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Schroeder-inspired topology**  
  Uses a combination of parallel comb filters and serial all-pass filters.

- **Novelty: very short delay enhancement**  
  Unlike most reverbs that rely only on longer delays for spaciousness, Reverb2 leverages *short micro-delays* to improve presence and timbral detail. This makes the reverb usable as both a spatial effect *and* a subtle enhancer.

- **Configurable delay lines**  
  Tune both long (RD) and short (VD) delay values, and feedback (gain) amounts.
  
- **Automatically saves output**  
  Saves the output to an 'output.wav' file for later playback.

- **Written in Java**  
  Portable across platforms, with no native dependencies.

- **Dual-licensed**  
  Open source under **GNU GPL v3**, with a separate **commercial license** available.
